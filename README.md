## Start your project

Run `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`) after you cloned the repo

## Developing

Run `npm run dev` to start a dev server (it will open a browser window)

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
